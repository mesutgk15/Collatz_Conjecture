# Collatz_Conjecture
The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. These operations are (n/2) if the number is even and (3n+1) if it is odd. Program is prompting user for a positive integer and calculates collatz and prints steps and how many steps it took to get to 1.
